Hey Guys, 
There‚Äôs nothing new in this but you found something special I thought that hold you guys to think for a sec. I am not good a writing .
This Scholarships give me hope for that **Why should I code** because before this I just code it‚Äôs just like hobby to me.
So, this story takes only 5 minutes of your precious time and I am sorry all of you for that. My grammar is not quite good.And I hope it be quite interesting for you. So, Here‚Äôs my story start.

### How I got knew about this program?

In the late December, I surf to the [Udacity](https://udacity.com) and read the blog of the [Udacity ](https://udacity.com)which are quite inspiring and I have a regular habit to read the blogs.
I surf over the blog and I saw something that is for me. I saw that Google got collaborate with [Udacity](https://udacity.com) and announces 30000 scholarships for 
*Mobile and Web Development*. And I passionate about **Web Development** so without wasting time to think about think I surf the application and view 
what they need and I saw something about that need a Github Reposritry(It‚Äôs optional) but I don‚Äôt want to loose any chance to this scholarship So
I thinking some and write my repo and in the late January I submit the form. I filled my form based for Front-End Track.

### That day came When I got my most beloved mail till now.

They said that the result got out on* Feb 8* and recipients got email about that But out on the *Feb 7* and It said that your application got accepted for 
Front-End Track and the classes start from *Feb 14*. It‚Äôs just like that I got the chance to prove myself.

### The Day when classes get started.

I called an ISP vendor and take a connection of Internet because before I used my friend‚Äôs *JIO*. So, Thanks [Udacity](https://udacity.com), now I have unlimited data. üòÑ
It‚Äôs the morning of Feb 14 and sit on my P.C and excited about the classes and the cohort of the program. I played the first video of the program in that
They said that there‚Äôs something called *Slack* and *Discussion Forum*(I knew about it) but I don‚Äôt about* Slack* and thought what this on the starting 2‚Äì3 days the link to slack is not opened yet.

### The Time When Everything got Setup.

Now, It‚Äôs the time when *Slack* got opened properly and I see that I just like an chatting app and through we got easily interacted with our cohort member.
And There‚Äôs discussion forum also where we can ask questions and answer the others question. And I liked it because I like to answer queries of others.
So, I answer others questions and also ask my queries. I answer as best I can.
Here‚Äôs my currently discussion forum progress.

And Now, I talked about Slack. I got addicted to it. It‚Äôs just like a habit to me to ask and answer and knew new stuff that I don‚Äôt know yet. 
It‚Äôs just like a medicine dose to me like You have to take it after wake up in morning and also take before you go to bed. üòÜ

And, After some days **Akshit Jain Sir** made announcement that anyone who wants to be a moderators just fill out a form. Without wasting the time I applied for moderator.

And After some days I got a message form **Akshit Jain Sir ** to be a moderator of *#live_help_official*(It‚Äôs the channel where a live help session is conducted twice a week). It also just like a appreciation for me.

And after some time *Iip Permana Sir([@iip](http://twitter.com/iip).udacity) *mentions my name in his good bye post before the session got over. It‚Äôs also kind of appreciation to me.

### One more Important announcement which gives a chance to **BE**.

![Mail got for Google I/O.](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*QLa0bIRpglEVVZ8kFzUhTg.png)*Mail got for Google I/O.*

Now, In at March 23 [****Akshit Jain  Sir*** made a another announcement in that He said that we got some surprise email. 
I check my mail without wasting the time. And a mail came from **Udacity India**. The mail said that win a chance for Google I/O and in that they told that for this you have to complete your challenge course by 80% percent.

At that time I completed 60% and I looked at the date there are 5 days to me and now I try to complete 80% by 28 May. And I complete and filled the form.
Now, I eagerly wait for the mail and at April 2 I got the mail from [****Akshit Jain  Sir*** in that He said **‚ÄúYou might need a chair somewhere near you so that you can sit and see the news I have got for you in this email.‚Äù** and **‚ÄúCongratulations! You have been selected as one of the waitlist participants for the trip to Google #IO18 on behalf of Google and Udacity.‚Äù**.

It‚Äôs just like a daydream to me but there‚Äôs a problem in this **I am not 18 yet and there‚Äôs only 2 months left to me for completing 18**. So, I told [****Akshit Jain  Sir*** about that But according to the terms of the contest I am have to be 18.

I thanked **[Udacity](https://udacity.com)** for this amazing cohort. They just like dying for help others. As well as in *Forum* or in *Slack* someone ask any query on any base I surely tell you won‚Äôt be disappointed. Even in night at any time you want to ask there are many night crow who are always waked and ready for help.
I don‚Äôt know how can they do that üòú. That‚Äôs the reason behind I got addicted to this community.
