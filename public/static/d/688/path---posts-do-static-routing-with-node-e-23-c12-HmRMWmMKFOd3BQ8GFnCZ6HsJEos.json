{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>So, first of all, why am I writing this because of when I started <strong>Node</strong> couple of days back, I got just frustrated with searching about how can I do static routing using Node but I can’t find anything good and I just go through every question of <strong>Stack Overflow</strong> but I can’t find anything good and everyone is talking about <strong>Express</strong> in every question it doesn’t matter whether the guy that asks the question only about in <strong>Node</strong>.\nSo, first of all, let’s talk about static routing.</p>\n<h2>What is Static Routing?</h2>\n<p>So, Static Routing is that kind of routing where we to set a router manually for a specific route. There are some demerits of it like everytime if we have a new file then we have set route for that file manually. And also it’s hard to handle the route for every file in our project.</p>\n<h2>Serve Static Files</h2>\n<p>So, let’s start routing i.e start making routes and serve files according to it.\nSo, we have our routes like this:-</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>“/”</strong> — <strong>index.html</strong></li>\n<li><strong>“/about”</strong> — <strong>about.html</strong></li>\n<li><strong>“/contact”</strong> — <strong>contact.html</strong></li>\n<li><strong>“/public/stylesheet/style.css”</strong> — <strong>style.css</strong></li>\n<li><strong>“/public/images/1.jpg”</strong> — <strong>1.jpg</strong></li>\n<li><strong>“/public/images/2.png”</strong> — <strong>2.png</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>And we have the directory like this:-</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">    public/\n      |\n      -&gt; index.html\n      -&gt; about.html\n      -&gt; contact.html\n      -&gt; stylesheet/\n            |\n            -&gt; style.css\n      -&gt; images/\n            |\n            -&gt; 1.jpg\n            -&gt; 2.png\n      |\n      index.js</code></pre></div>\n<p>So, first we have to create our server first:-</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3440/1*e7oNU6yQMqDXJfGepEBXkA.png\" alt=\"Created Server\"><em>Created Server</em></p>\n<p>Now, we created our server so we need <strong>fs</strong> package. Then we have to take the benefit of <strong>Node JS</strong> <strong>request</strong> object that contains two special property i.e <strong>url</strong> and <strong>method</strong>. The <em>request.method</em> gave us the method of the request and <em>request.url</em> will give us the browser’s request URL that the browser requested for. Now it’s time to check for the URL and method and serve the static pages.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3664/1*kA67K--nS6Dki-P2uODhSg.png\" alt=\"Make a route and render file according to it.\"> <em>Make a route and render file according to it.</em></p>\n<p>And follow the above same steps and every time just change the <strong>case</strong> and read the file for that specific kind and just change the header every time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2584/1*oT3nyg9uGdmWpazzgsWZ0g.png\" alt=\"Headers for specific files\"><em>Headers for specific files</em></p>\n<p>So, you have done your static routing with node. 😄</p>\n<p>Follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/am_pra_veen\">Twitter</a>.\nFollow me on <a href=\"https://github.com/praveen-me\">Github</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Do Static Routing with Node"}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://praveen-me.now.sh"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/posts/do-static-routing-with-node/"}}
