{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p><strong>A scope</strong> is like a limited area. Scopes are the essential part of every programming language. They are behaving like a limited space for a declaration i.e where every variable is declared and what part of the program that variable can be accessed.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scope\">MDN</a> Says — <strong>The context in which values and expressions are “visible,” or can be referenced.</strong></p>\n<p>There are two types of scopes:-</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Global Scope</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Local Scope\nBut I also going to talk about <strong>Lexical Scope</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What is Global Scope?</h2>\n<p>Global Scope is a term used when a variable is declared outside any of the functions i.e the variables should be declared globally.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">var</span> a <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">'global'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>               <span class=\"token comment\">//I am a global scope</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">iAmLocal</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>           <span class=\"token comment\">//I am a global scope</span>\n  console<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>a<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// 'global'  </span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>                               <span class=\"token comment\">//I am a global scope</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>So, If you look at the above function there’s variable <strong>a</strong> is declared globally and it can be accessed inside the function. Here, <strong>iAmLocal()</strong> function created its own scope. But here’s the variable is declared in global scope. So, the point is that if we declared a variable globally it can be accessed inside a function.</p>\n<p>Let's take another example:-</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">var</span> a <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">'global'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> \n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">iAmLocal</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  a <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">'is I am local'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"token function\">iAmLocal</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\na<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>   <span class=\"token comment\">//Think and let's give it a moment ??</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>So, the value of the variable should be changed or not. Let’s know it by executing it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2398/0*gYbVqMpscLSHgq5K.png\"></p>\n<p>It changed because the variable <strong>a</strong> is accessible inside the function because it is declared globally. So, when we call the <strong>IAmLocal()</strong> function, that reassigned the value of <strong>a</strong> again. Now, let’s go to local scope.</p>\n<h2>What is Local Scope?</h2>\n<p>When we declare a function it creates its own scope. So, whenever a function is declared it creates its local scope which is limited to that function. So, it means that if you are declared a variable inside a function it’s limited to it. So, Let’s understand it by a code example:-</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://medium.com/media/a7b4663e506945cfc03da7d2ff7a40a3\" frameborder=0></iframe>\n<p>Let’s access the variable outside the function.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*BdTnoZybU23OBJiV.png\"></p>\n<p>OOPS!! It says an error because now the engine looks for the variable <strong>b</strong> globally but it can’t find the value because it is declared in the <strong>iAmLocal()</strong>. So, that’s why it returns an <strong>error</strong>.</p>\n<p>Let’s take another example:-</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://medium.com/media/936333ada3e28a4901f4d4fec3fc43b8\" frameborder=0></iframe>\n<p>So, can we access <strong>a</strong> inside the <strong>secondNumber()</strong>. Let’s try it by running it. If we get <strong>15</strong>, that means we can.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2082/0*hz7apAaSbtZ1py_3.png\"></p>\n<p>Yes, It is.</p>\n<h2>Why is that happen?</h2>\n<p>Because when <strong>sum()</strong> is declared it creates its own scope and the variables that are declared inside it can be accessible limited to the scope of the <strong>sum()</strong>. But when we declaring the <strong>secondNumber()</strong> function inside the <strong>sum()</strong> it also creates its own scope. So, when we called <strong>secondNumber()</strong> it gonna look for the value of <strong>a</strong>. It doesn’t find <strong>a</strong> it goes to it parent and checks if there’s <strong>a</strong> is not. Ya, It’s find there and execute that value successfully.</p>\n<h2>== Lexical Scope ==</h2>\n<p>So, Lexical Scope is the same as the nested local scopes but there be little bit difference between them. In this, if the current scope doesn’t find the value then it moves outside to that scope and tries to find the value there. This process continues until it finds the value. Let’s do it by an example:-</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://medium.com/media/6f3026eab22c70920af2f4934a53ee8a\" frameborder=0></iframe>\n<p>So, In the above code sample, I declared <strong>num1</strong> globally because it’s outside all the loops. Now, when we declared the <strong>add()</strong> function it creates it’s own scope. That’s why <strong>num2</strong> is declared locally so it available in the scope of the <strong>add()</strong> function. So, let’s think and look the code carefully that it gives us the <strong>13</strong> or not.\nLet’s execute it:-</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*C7L8i_uPeEWAs3Xw.png\"></p>\n<p><strong><em>So, what happened here?</em></strong>\nLet’s go on that line where we called the <strong>add()</strong> and stored this in the variable called <strong>addIt()</strong>. So, now <strong>addIt()</strong> holds the return function that is returned by the <strong>add()</strong> function and when we call the returned function we got the correct answer. So, the thing is that how can it access the value of <strong>num1</strong>. So, I write above that if the variable doesn’t find it’s value inside that function so it bubbles out i.e it goes upwards. So, now in the function that is returned by the <strong>add()</strong> function. Now, <strong>num1</strong> finds that is my value presented in this scope if it doesn’t so it moves in the scope of the <strong>add()</strong> and checks it that my value is presented here or not. No, It goes to the global scope where it finds the value and executes it. So, the process of bubbling out and finding it’s value is called <strong>lexical scope</strong>.\nIf it doesn’t find the value then it returns an error saying that variable is not defined.</p>\n<h2>Let &#x26; Const -> How They Effect Scope</h2>\n<p>So, let and const are new members in the family of variables declarations in JavaScript. So, they help us to create a scope and helps the variable to not get hoisted. Let’s take an example:-</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://medium.com/media/e9e19637948aac984a96779d2b73a0a1\" frameborder=0></iframe>\n<p>Let’s check out it:-</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*fY4-jWneHGHt0pOj.png\"></p>\n<p>So, we can access the variable <strong>i</strong> outside the loop because we know that only function can create their own scope. So, <strong>for loop</strong> declared in the global scope. That’s why in the last when the loop got executed we got the increased value of <strong>i</strong>.\nLet’s do it again but put <strong>let</strong> instead of <strong>var</strong> :-</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://medium.com/media/84390599e9e516c1717a0cb685d7bbe6\" frameborder=0></iframe>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Xr4qxHLAG4TfWen_V3idkw.png\"></p>\n<p>Ya, it said a <strong>error</strong> saying <strong>*i</strong> is not defined* because <strong>let</strong> creates a scope to that variable.\n<strong>const</strong> is also same as the <strong>let</strong> but you can’t reassign a value again. So, assigning value with <strong>var</strong>, <strong>let</strong> and <strong>const</strong> depends on your need that you want to access that variable locally or want to update the variable as value reassigned to it.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading…</p>\n<p>Follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/am_pra_veen\">**Twitter</a>** and check all these Gists on <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/praveen-me\">**GitHub</a>**.</p>\n<p><em>Originally published at <a href=\"https://praveen-me.github.io/blog/javascript-scopes\">https://praveen-me.github.io/blog/javascript-scopes</a> on September 6, 2018.</em></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Scope: Local, Global and Lexical"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/posts/scope-local-global-and-lexical/"}}
